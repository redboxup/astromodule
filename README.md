# Summary of work: Astrometric Analysis of Open Clusters
 
----------------------------------------------

We performed Astrometric Analysis on Open Star clusters to determine parameters like parallax, propermotion, distance from sun & galactic centre and then determine age of the cluster. 

We chose open clusters M67 & Hyades. We used the data from the Gaia Early Data Release 3 to perform the analysis.
