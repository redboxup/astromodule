# Summary of work: Astrometric Analysis of Open Clusters
 
----------------------------------------------

## Abstract

The primary objective of the project was to study and identify the astrometric paprameters of M67 and Hyades open cluster, using data provided by ESO Gaia Survey in Early Data Relase 3 (EDR3). Firstly, most probable members of the respective open clusters were identified by proper motion analysis. Next, the Colour Magnitude Diagram (CMD) of the cluster is created. Then a theoretical isochrone curve is fitted to determine important astrometric parameters of the cluster.
